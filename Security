## Security

We take security seriously and recommend the following best practices:

### 🔐 Secure Credentials
- Never hardcode sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or API keys directly in your code. Use environment variables or external configuration files to store sensitive data securely.
- For Telegram Bot API tokens, make sure they are stored safely, and only share them with trusted parties.
- If using a public repository, **never** expose sensitive credentials or keys in your commits. Use `.gitignore` to ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive data.

### 🌐 HTTPS Communication
- Ensure all sensitive communication (such as the Telegram Bot API requests) is done over HTTPS to prevent any interception of data.
- Use SSL/TLS certificates to protect your server’s communication channels and ensure that data is encrypted in transit.

### 📡 Network Security
- Use a strong and unique Wi-Fi password for devices connecting to your local network.
- If your device is accessible over the internet, implement firewalls, VPNs, or other security layers to restrict access and monitor traffic.

### 🔄 Regular Updates
- Regularly update your libraries and dependencies to ensure that you are protected from known vulnerabilities.
- Check for firmware or software updates for your hardware components (e.g., ESP32) to ensure that you are using the latest, most secure version.

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Testing
- Regularly run vulnerability tests on your system to ensure no security flaws are present.
- Implement logging and monitoring for any suspicious activity, including unauthorized access attempts or unusual behavior.

By following these security practices, you can help ensure that your system remains secure and protected from potential threats.
